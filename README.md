# Principal-Component-Analysis
University Trier - Multivariate Statistics - Exercise 2.1

# Summary of UKZ dataset
1. Upload the UKZ Locust Trust Bank dataset and execute the covariance principle component analysis with R command prcomp().
2. Also execute singular value decomposition with R command svd().
3. Based on the information of the used dataset, is the covariance principle analysis is not appropriate then apply a correlation principle component.
4. And also Calculate the corresponding score-matrix T.

# Summary of SPD dataset
1. Upload SPD dataset and remove all non-numerical columns in this dataset. Save the key figures of all companies which do not have missing values in a matrix. Name the rows of the matrix using the corresponding company names.
2. Decide correlation principle component analysis and execute the correspondence analysis.
3. Then calculate the corresponding loadings matrix V. Which relationships do the variables from the original dataset and the new principle components have.
4. Afterthen, calculate the matrix of the squared entries of V. Round the results to two decimals.
5. Which communalities will result if you use all principal components?
6. We checked the  variable Price.earnings to be still well explained in a reduced mode. In this case we consider second principal component.
7. Then we calculate the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the scaled and centred data matrix.
8. Also Calculate the relative proportion of the variance which is explained by the corresponding principal components. Cumulate these proportions.
9. Then we select principal components according to the Kaiser Gutmann criteria.
10. Also draw a Scree-plot as a bar graph as well as a line diagram.
11. To select principal componenets we choose at least 85% of the total variance.
12. Then we choose all PC which explain more than the mean vairance of the single components.
